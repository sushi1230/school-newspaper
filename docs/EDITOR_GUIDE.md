# School Newspaper Editor's Guide

Welcome to the School Newspaper website! This guide explains how to publish articles without needing any technical knowledge. Everything is done through Google Docs and Google Sheets.

## Overview

The system works like this:

1. **You write articles** in Google Docs
2. **You add metadata** in a Google Sheet (title, author, date, category, etc.)
3. **The website automatically displays** your articles

That's it! No coding required.

## Step 1: Understanding the Structure

### Google Drive Folder Organization

Your articles are organized in Google Drive like this:

```
School Newspaper Articles/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Campus News/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sports & Activities/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Arts & Culture/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Opinion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Student Life/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Student Profiles/
```

**You don't have to use these folders**, but organizing by category makes it easier to keep track of things.

### Master Google Sheet

There's a Google Sheet called **"School Newspaper Articles"** that lists all your articles. Think of it as the "control center" for your newspaper.

---

## Step 2: Writing Your First Article

### Option A: Writing in Google Docs (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Google Doc**
   - Go to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document)
   - Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Document"
   - Give it a title (this will be your article title)

2. **Write your article**
   - Write the article content as you normally would
   - Use formatting: **bold**, *italics*, lists, headings, etc.
   - All of this will be preserved when displayed on the website

3. **Save it to a category folder** (optional but helpful)
   - Click "Move" (in Google Docs)
   - Select the appropriate folder (Sports, Arts, etc.)

### Option B: Pasting from Word/Google Docs

If you've already written your article elsewhere:
1. Copy your text
2. Open a new Google Doc
3. Paste your content
4. Follow steps 2-3 above

---

## Step 3: Get Your Article's Google Doc ID

Every Google Doc has a unique ID that helps the website find it.

**How to find it:**

1. Open your Google Doc
2. Look at the URL in your browser address bar
3. Find the part that looks like: `https://docs.google.com/document/d/**1ABC2def3GHI4jkl**5/edit`
4. **Copy the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`** (in this example: `1ABC2def3GHI4jkl5`)

**Save this ID somewhere** - you'll need it in the next step.

---

## Step 4: Add Your Article to the Master Sheet

Now you'll tell the website about your article by adding it to the master spreadsheet.

1. **Open the "School Newspaper Articles" Google Sheet**
   - Your editor-in-chief should give you access to this

2. **Click on the next empty row** at the bottom

3. **Fill in each column:**

   | Column | What to enter | Example |
   |--------|---------------|---------|
   | **A: Title** | Your article title | "New Sports Facility Opens" |
   | **B: Author** | Your name | "John Smith" |
   | **C: Category** | Section type | "Sports" (must match the folders) |
   | **D: Date** | When it was written | "2024-10-21" (YYYY-MM-DD format) |
   | **E: Google Doc ID** | The ID from Step 3 | "1ABC2def3GHI4jkl5" |
   | **F: Featured** | Is this the main story? | "TRUE" or "FALSE" |
   | **G: Excerpt** | 1-2 sentence summary | "The new gym facility is now open..." |
   | **H: Image URL** | Link to an image | "https://example.com/image.jpg" |

### Example Row:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New Sports Facility Opens | John Smith | Sports | 2024-10-21 | 1ABC2def3GHI4jkl | TRUE | The new gym facility is now open and ready for use. | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1461896836934-ffe607ba8211?w=600&h=400&fit=crop |

---

## Step 5: Add an Image to Your Article

The website shows a thumbnail image for each article in the grid. You'll need to provide a URL to an image.

### Option A: Use an Image You Uploaded to Google Drive

1. Upload an image to Google Drive (in your article folder if possible)
2. Right-click it ‚Üí "Get link"
3. Make sure "Anyone with the link" can view it
4. Copy the link
5. Paste it in the "Image URL" column

### Option B: Use a Free Stock Photo

You can use any free stock photo service:

- **Unsplash** (https://unsplash.com) - Best for high-quality news photos
- **Pexels** (https://pexels.com) - Good variety
- **Pixabay** (https://pixabay.com) - Lots of free images

Steps:
1. Search for a relevant image
2. Download it OR right-click ‚Üí "Copy image link"
3. Use that URL in the "Image URL" column

### Example Image URLs:
```
https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1461896836934-ffe607ba8211?w=600&h=400&fit=crop
https://images.pexels.com/photos/3823517/pexels-photo-3823517.jpeg
```

1. **Wait 1 hour** - The website updates every hour

2. **Visit the website** and look for your article

3. **If it doesn't appear:**
   - Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
